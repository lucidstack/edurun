      <h3>education in the uk</h3>
      <p>
        In response to the recession and falling standards of schooling, the conservative government of the time decided to increase the budget of the education system. The conservatives wanted a more centralised and standardised education, that focused on increasing young peoples chances of finding employment.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1980 the education reform act was announced, leading to a compulsory
        curriculum and the open enrollement of pupils, as well as setting up
        assessments at the end of each key stage.
      </p>

      <p>
        1981 saw the push for vocational subjects with Technical and Vocational
        Education Initiative (TVEI) being announced. However, out of the 25
        programmes established, 22 were cancelled and in 1986, NVQ’s were
        created to replace them.
      </p>

      <p>
        In 1985 the Better Schools programme was announced, this aimed to raise
        all standards of ability, promote enterprise and increase employment
        chances.
      </p>

      <p>
        Alongside the introduction of the curriculum and league tables, there
        was the new Ofsted, which forced schools to look into more marketing
        strategies to help capture pupils, or they would be forced to close.
      </p>

      <p>
        These changes led to schools having more autonomy over their budget, as
        well as giving parents the choice of where to send their children.

      <h3>education 5 to 9 survey</h3>
      <p>
        In 1982, there was a survey published by the Department of Education
        and Science, which made the following points about primary schools:
      </p>

      <p>
        Most primary schools fell between the extremes of very good and very
        poor, with most offering a good education to children aged between 5
        and 9. Children’s behaviour and personal relations in schools were
        developing well.
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of academic achievement, it was found that nearly all children
        were making a satisfactory start in learning literacy and maths, but
        that the development of these skills widely varied, and that certain
        schools were spending too much time on teaching them. It was found that
        schools are doing a satisfactory job of helping ethnic minorities learn
        English. On the other hand, mathematical skills are usually practised
        too much without application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Furthermore, despite the fact that the topics and activities are well
        planned, they are not linked in a way that develops skills and
        understanding.
      </p>

      <p>
        In schools where there are children with learning difficulties, there
        is a quick turnaround in helping them, but not when it comes to
        educational psychologists and psychiatrists, meaning they may trail
        behind. Linking to this, where there are higher achieving children,
        they are rarely given the help to make more progress. This is a bigger
        problem in classes that have a mixed age group, where the those on
        either side of the learning spectrum may suffer some neglect.
      </p>

      <p>
        In terms of teaching, there needs to be more in-school training, and
        more help with teachers who wish to move up the ladder. However, First
        School teachers need to be checked to ensure they are teaching
        properly.
