        <h3>education in the uk</h3>
        <p>
          In response to the recession and falling standards of schooling, the conservative government of the time decided to increase the budget of the education system. The conservatives wanted a more centralised and standardised education, that focused on increasing young peoples chances of finding employment.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1980 the education reform act was announced, leading to a compulsory
          curriculum and the open enrollement of pupils, as well as setting up
          assessments at the end of each key stage.
        </p>

        <p>
          1981 saw the push for vocational subjects with Technical and Vocational
          Education Initiative (TVEI) being announced. However, out of the 25
          programmes established, 22 were cancelled and in 1986, NVQ’s were
          created to replace them.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1985 the Better Schools programme was announced, this aimed to raise
          all standards of ability, promote enterprise and increase employment
          chances.
        </p>

        <p>
          In 1988 the National Curriculum was introduced, despite it not being
          fully prescriptivist, it became the guidelines of what teachers could
          strive for and work upon.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alongside the introduction of the curriculum and league tables, there
          was the new Ofsted, which forced schools to look into more marketing
          strategies to help capture pupils, or they would be forced to close.
        </p>

        <p>
          These changes led to schools having more autonomy over their budget, as
          well as giving parents the choice of where to send their children.

        <h3>education 5 to 9 survey</h3>
        <p>
          In 1982, there was a survey published by the Department of Education
          and Science, which made the following points about primary schools:
        </p>

        <p>
          Most primary schools fell between the extremes of very good and very
          poor, with most offering a good education to children aged between 5
          and 9. Children’s behaviour and personal relations in schools were
          developing well.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of academic achievement, it was found that nearly all children
          were making a satisfactory start in learning literacy and maths, but
          that the development of these skills widely varied, and that certain
          schools were spending too much time on teaching them. It was found that
          schools are doing a satisfactory job of helping ethnic minorities learn
          English. On the other hand, mathematical skills were usually practised
          too much without application.
        </p>

        <p>
          Furthermore, despite the fact that the topics and activities are well
          planned, they are not linked in a way that develops skills and
          understanding.
        </p>

        <p>
          In schools where there were children with learning difficulties, it
          was found that there was a quick turnaround in helping them, but not
          when it came to educational psychologists and psychiatrists, meaning
          the diagnosis may have trailed behind. Linking to this, where there
          were higher achieving children, they were rarely given the help to
          make more progress. This was a bigger problem in classes that had a
          mixed age group, where the those on either side of the learning
          spectrum may have suffered some neglect.
        </p>

        <p>
          In terms of teaching, it was found that there needed to be more in-school
          training, and more help with teachers who wished to move up the ladder.
          However, First School teachers needed to be checked to ensure they were
          teaching properly.

        <h4>Netherlands</h4>
        <p>
          The Primary Education Act 1981 and the main aims are:
        </p>
        <ul>

          <li>

          </li>
        </ul>

        <h4>New Zealand</h4>
        <p>
          In 1988 the Department of Education published a draft of the curriculum and here are the aims:
        </p>

            </li>
            <li>
              Despite this draft not being implemented because of political changes, there was still a focus on equity and citizenship.
            </li>
          </ul>

        <h4>Sweden</h4>
        <p>

              Provide students with knowledge and skills to succeed in life
            </li>
            <li>

        <h3>differences</h3>

        <p>
          There are a few differences between the examples given, and the UK.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sweden, New Zealand and the Netherlands all seemed to prioritize
          freedom of belief and creativity whereas the UK took a stronger stance
          on the core subjects of English and Mathematics.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, the Netherlands focused on a child-centered approach towards
          primary teaching. The UK was still following a very didactic way of
          teaching, despite the Plowden Report (1967) favouring the child
          centered approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another difference would be that both New Zealand &amp; the Netherlands
          used schooling as a tool to fight inequality and cater for minority
          groups. Despite some efforts being made to do this in the UK, the
          schooling system still followed a very functionalist style whereby
          students could still be pigeonholed.
